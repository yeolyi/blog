- Use Bun as the package manager.
- Use Next.js 15 as the framework.
- Use Tailwind CSS for all styling.
- When implementing Server Actions, always handle errors and return a response in the following format: { success: true, value: T } | { success: false, message: string }
- Prefer using throwOnError when working with Supabase to simplify error handling.
- Use lucide icon package.
- Use uncontrolled component for form. Prefer native html solution.
- Prefer type to interface for type declaration
- Prefer using the components from the /components/ui folder instead of implementing basic UI elements from scratch.
- When designing components, avoid using border radius. Use constants(like colors) from components/ui/theme.ts whenever possible.
- Only Next.js-related files (like layout.tsx, page.tsx, loading.tsx, etc.) should go in the app folder. Manage all components in the components folder.
- Keep things simple
- Prefer short variable name. index -> idx, value -> val-
