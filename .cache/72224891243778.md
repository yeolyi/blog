> In computer science, an abstract data type (ADT) is a mathematical model for data types. An abstract data type is defined by its behavior (semantics) from the point of view of a user, of the data, specifically in terms of possible values, possible operations on data of this type, and the behavior of these operations.

> This mathematical model **contrasts with data structures**, which are concrete representations of data, and are the point of view of an implementer, not a user. \_\_Wikipedia

어떠한 자료구조이건 간에 '자료구조의 구현'과 '구현된 자료구조의 활용'은 완전히구분되도록 ADT를 정의해야 한다.
