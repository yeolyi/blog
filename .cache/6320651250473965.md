## API

> An application programming interface (API) is a connection between computers or between computer programs. It is a type of software interface, offering a service to other pieces of software

## Library

> In computer science, a library is a collection of non-volatile resources used by computer programs, often for software development. These may include configuration data, documentation, help data, message templates, pre-written code and subroutines, classes, values or type specifications.

API 문서에 여러 활용이 명시되어있다. API는 '하는 일'에 대해 서술하고 라이브버리는 '실제 구현'이라고한다.

> The interface to a **software library** is one type of API. The API describes and prescribes the "expected behavior" (a specification) while the library is an "actual implementation" of this set of rules.

> An API can specify the interface between an application and the **operating system.** POSIX, for example, specifies a set of common APIs that aim to enable an application written for a POSIX conformant operating system to be compiled for another POSIX conformant operating system.
