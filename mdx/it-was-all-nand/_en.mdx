One fascinating fact in computer science is that you can build an entire
computer just by combining simple logic gates called NAND. Check out the
behavior of a NAND gate in the component below. You can change its input values
by clicking the squares.

<Nand initialJSON={nand} id="nand" />

You can see that when both inputs are <span className="text-green-500">1</span>,
the NAND gate's output is <span className="text-red-500">0</span>, and in all
other cases, the output is <span className="text-green-500">1</span>.

Isn't it amazing that you can assemble these NAND gates to create computers,
CPUs, and memory? Understanding this might also help you grasp how computers can
be implemented in games like Minecraft.

## NOT Gate

Let's build a NOT gate, which outputs the **opposite** of the input, using NAND
gates.

<Nand initialJSON={not} id="not" />

We implemented NOT using a NAND gate by feeding the same value into both inputs.

## AND Gate

Now, let's build an AND gate, which outputs 1 only when **both** inputs are 1,
using NAND gates.

<Nand initialJSON={and} id="and" />

Since we have NAND and NOT, creating AND is simple. A NAND gate followed by a
NOT gate results in an AND gate (NAND + NOT = AND).

## OR Gate

Let's try building an OR gate, which outputs 1 when **at least one** input is 1.

<Nand id="tmp" />

If that was too easy, try building an XOR gate (Exclusive OR), which outputs 1
only when **exactly one** input is 1.

## The Significance of AND, OR, and NOT

So, we've confirmed that we can create AND, OR, and NOT gates using only NAND
gates. But why are these specific gates (AND, OR, NOT) so important?

First, let's consider the meaning of **0 and 1**. Computers store and process
all data—photos, videos, text—as collections of 0s and 1s in memory. Therefore,
operations like photo editing or text modification can be seen internally as
operations on these 0s and 1s. You can think of these operations as **functions
that take 0s and 1s as input and produce transformed 0s and 1s as output**.

Here's the crucial point: **With just AND, OR, and NOT gates, we can create
_any_ possible function** that operates on binary inputs. For example, consider
the XOR function, which has the following input/output behavior:

|  A  |  B  | A XOR B |
| :-: | :-: | :-----: |
|  0  |  0  |    0    |
|  0  |  1  |    1    |
|  1  |  0  |    1    |
|  1  |  1  |    0    |

Let's focus on the cases where the output is 1:

- The case (A=0, B=1) can be represented as `(NOT A) AND B`.
- The case (A=1, B=0) can be represented as `(A) AND (NOT B)`.

By combining these two AND terms (called minterms) with an OR operation, the XOR
function can be expressed as:

`((NOT A) AND B) OR (A AND (NOT B))`

This method, where you identify the input combinations that produce a 1, express
each as an AND term (using NOT where the input is 0), and then combine these
terms with OR (known as the sum-of-products form), allows you to construct any
desired Boolean function.

As we've demonstrated that NAND can be used to create AND, OR, and NOT, it means
NAND alone is sufficient. This property is called
[functional completeness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_completeness).
Other functionally complete sets besides \{ NAND } include \{ NOR }, and the set
\{ AND, NOT } (which we effectively derived from NAND).

## What's Next

However, there are tasks that cannot be represented solely by these types of
functions (known as combinational logic). For example, tasks like counting how
many times a button has been pressed require a system that can handle temporal
order or remember previous events (maintain state). In the next post, we'll
explore **memory** and sequential logic.
