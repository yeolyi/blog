While writing code to query a database using Supabase, I became curious about
the exact moment an asynchronous request is made. It felt different from my
usual experience using Promise objects.

## The Curiosity

Generally, the point at which a Promise object is created and the point at which
the asynchronous request begins are the same. Think about using `Workspace` or
`setTimeout`. For example, the `delay` function below, created using
`setTimeout`, starts its asynchronous operation immediately when the Promise
object is created.

```js
const delay = (ms) => new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, ms));
delay(1000); // Starts counting 1 second right here, regardless of await
```

However, with Supabase, the asynchronous request isn't made until `await` is
used. Thanks to this characteristic, you can conditionally add clauses to the
query and then initiate the asynchronous request with `await` once the query is
fully constructed.

```ts
let query = supabase.from('...').select('...');
if (tagIds) query = query.in('id', tagIds);

// [!code highlight]
const { data, error } = await query; // The request happens here
```

Another peculiar point is that even if you use `await` multiple times on the
same builder object (after modifying it), it correctly sends requests
corresponding to the query's state at that moment.

```ts
let query = supabase.from('...').select('...');
// [!code highlight]
let { data, error } = await query; // ✅ Request 1

query = query.order('created_at', { ascending: true });
// [!code highlight]
{ data, error } = await query; // ✅ Request 2 with ordering applied
```

If you look at the types of methods like `select` or `order`, they return custom
objects like `PostgrestTransformBuilder` or `PostgrestFilterBuilder`, not
Promises. I understand they utilized the
[Builder pattern](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/builder) to construct
queries step-by-step, but how can you `await` an object that isn't a Promise?

## Research

Checking the
[Supabase source code](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/supabase/postgrest-js/blob/master/src/PostgrestBuilder.ts%23L15),
both `PostgrestTransformBuilder` and `PostgrestFilterBuilder` are classes that
extend (`extends`) `PostgrestBuilder`. And `PostgrestBuilder` implements
(`implements`) `PromiseLike`.

```ts
export default abstract class PostgrestBuilder<
  Result,
  ThrowOnError extends boolean = false,
> implements
    PromiseLike<
      ThrowOnError extends true
        ? PostgrestResponseSuccess<Result>
        : PostgrestSingleResponse<Result>
    > {
  // ...
}
```

Looking at the
[TypeScript source code](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/blob/main/src/lib/es5.d.ts%23L1512),
`PromiseLike` refers to an object that implements a `then` method.

```ts
interface PromiseLike<T> {
  /**
   * Attaches callbacks for the resolution and/or rejection of the Promise.
   * @param onfulfilled The callback to execute when the Promise is resolved.
   * @param onrejected The callback to execute when the Promise is rejected.
   * @returns A Promise for the completion of which ever callback is executed.
   */
  then<TResult1 = T, TResult2 = never>(
    onfulfilled?:
      | ((value: T) => TResult1 | PromiseLike<TResult1>)
      | undefined
      | null,
    onrejected?:
      | ((reason: any) => TResult2 | PromiseLike<TResult2>)
      | undefined
      | null,
  ): PromiseLike<TResult1 | TResult2>;
}
```

Therefore, `PostgrestBuilder` must implement the `then` method. Let's examine
it.

```ts
// Some code omitted
export default abstract class PostgrestBuilder {
  constructor(builder: PostgrestBuilder) {
    //...
    if (builder.fetch) {
      this.fetch = builder.fetch;
    } else if (typeof fetch === 'undefined') {
      // Use node-fetch in Node.js environments
      this.fetch = nodeFetch;
    } else {
      // Use the global fetch in browser environments
      this.fetch = fetch;
    }
  }

  // [!code highlight:14]
  then<TResult1 = Result, TResult2 = never>(
    onfulfilled?:
      | ((
          value: ThrowOnError extends true
            ? PostgrestResponseSuccess<Result>
            : PostgrestSingleResponse<Result>,
        ) => TResult1 | PromiseLike<TResult1>)
      | undefined
      | null,
    onrejected?:
      | ((reason: any) => TResult2 | PromiseLike<TResult2>)
      | undefined
      | null,
  ): PromiseLike<TResult1 | TResult2> {
    // Add schema profile header if needed
    // ...
    const _fetch = this.fetch; // Use the fetch determined in the constructor

    // Perform the actual fetch request
    let res = _fetch(this.url.toString(), {
      method: this.method,
      headers: this.headers,
      body: JSON.stringify(this.body),
      signal: this.signal,
    }).then(async (res) => {
      // Process the response...
      // ...
    });
    // More response processing...
    // ...
    // Chain the user's callbacks
    return res.then(onfulfilled, onrejected);
  }
}
```

We can confirm that the actual network request is made within the `then` method.
It's also quite impressive how the constructor sets up the appropriate
`Workspace` function depending on the environment where Supabase is being used.

## Conclusion

I need to abandon the fixed idea that the target of `await` must always be a
Promise object. The code below works perfectly fine:

```js
const obj = {
  then(resolve, reject) {
    // This object behaves like a Promise because it has a 'then' method
    console.log('then method called by await');
    resolve('hello from thenable');
  },
};

async function test() {
  console.log('Before await');
  const res = await obj; // 'await' calls the 'then' method
  console.log('After await:', res);
}

test();
// Output:
// Before await
// then method called by await
// After await: hello from thenable
```

There's also relevant information on the MDN
[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)
page, which I'll quote here:

> The JavaScript ecosystem had made multiple Promise implementations long before
> it became part of the language. Despite being represented differently
> internally, at the minimum, all Promise-like objects implement the Thenable
> interface. A thenable implements the .then() method, which is called with two
> callbacks: one for when the promise is fulfilled, one for when it's rejected.
> Promises are thenables as well.

> To interoperate with the existing Promise implementations, the language allows
> using thenables in place of promises. For example, Promise.resolve will not
> only resolve promises, but also trace thenables.

This explains how `await` (which essentially works with Promises) can operate on
objects like Supabase's query builders, as long as they implement the `then`
method, making them "thenable" or `PromiseLike`.
