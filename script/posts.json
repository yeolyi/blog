I took over this criminal piece of chaos from a monkey named Joel who I assume had been given a typewriter by Mephistopheles himself. For reasons I have yet been unable to fathom, he decided to patch together this thing using a BaseX setup hardwired into an unfixably broken Manjaro VM, queried by a handwritten plate of uncommented PHP spaghetti fit to feed an army of people with a serious death wish, without any framework or CMS. The very long BaseX script, very long PHP presenter and very long XSLT stylesheet mostly perform the same heuristic document structuring for different components and are supposed to produce compatible results, but I bet they have mismatches somewhere. Since Prof. T just wanted a few small functional enhancements, I decided to just patch it and keep the general setup. Unless you were hired to correct some spelling mistakes, DO NOT FOLLOW IN MY STEPS. Putting up with this simulation of how a goldfish would design a system has literally given me CLINICAL DEPRESSION. This is not an exaggeration, I am writing this after a prolonged medical therapy - mostly successful, thanks for asking, but not fun. I wouldn't wish this code on anybody who isn't a manager at Oracle or Facebook, and therefore give you this sincere advice: Nuke this. Take the XSLT if you must, and then nuke the app and recreate it in Django or whatever works for you. I would do it myself, but I risked a relapse simply by opening this file again to write this comment. Dear brother or sister, I wish you all the luck and strength in the world and hope it will be enough.

You know, that type of a guy who loves Vim, creates diagrams in Dot and writes wiki-posts in Markdown... If something - anything - requires more than 90 seconds of his time, he writes a script to automate that. xxx: So we're sitting here, looking through his, uhm, &quot;legacy&quot; xxx: You're gonna love this xxx: smack-my-bitch-up.sh - sends a text message &quot;late at work&quot; to his wife (apparently). Automatically picks reasons from an array of strings, randomly. Runs inside a cron-job. The job fires if there are active SSH-sessions on the server after 9pm with his login. xxx: kumar-asshole.sh - scans the inbox for emails from &quot;Kumar&quot; (a DBA at our clients). Looks for keywords like &quot;help&quot;, &quot;trouble&quot;, &quot;sorry etc. If keywords are found - the script SSHes into the clients server and rolls back the staging database to the latest backup. Then sends a reply &quot;no worries mate, be careful next time&quot;. xxx: hangover.sh - another cron-job that is set to specific dates. Sends automated emails like &quot;not feeling wellgonna work from home&quot; etc. Adds a random &quot;reason&quot; from another predefined array of strings. Fires if there are no interactive sessions on the server at 8:45am. xxx: (and the oscar goes to) fucking-coffee.sh - this one waits exactly 17 seconds (!), then opens a telnet session to our coffee-machine (we had no frikin idea the coffee machine is on the network, runs linux and has a TCP socket up and running) and sends something like sys brew. Turns out this thing starts brewing a mid-sized half-caf latte and waits another 24 (I) seconds before pouring it into a cup. The timing is exactly how long it takes to walk to the machine from the dudes desk. xxx: holy sht I'm keeping those",

How old is my sister? &quot;As Answer a) Follow 97 Request 01 S 000 100 Answers Samuel Lipoff, studied at Harvard University Updated 17h ago This is a tough one. She might be 42, but she could be 41 or 43 also, since you don't say when your birthday is and her birthday is. Also, she could be dead. Finally, you might have thought she was your sister but actually your mom had an affair with another man and the woman who is 1-3 years younger than you is not actually your sister. But your mom may have given away your real sister for adoption, in which case she's probably older than you. See why it's tough? Finally, what if you think your sister is dead, but she actually has become an astronaut on a secret government project for near light-speed travel? Then your sister would be aging more slowly than you, so she could potentially be even younger than 41",

It's like giving directions to a baby that has the ability to understand and implement what you are saying and telling it to do, but none of the life experience to infer about what you're telling it. You can't just say: &quot;go get the shovel&quot;. If I asked you that, you would just go to the shed and grab it for me. With the programming baby, you have to explain what a shovel is, and where the shovel is, and how the baby can &quot;get&quot; the shovel, in order for the baby to be able to do anything. It will also do EXACTLY as you ask, and nothing more. I tell the baby that the shovel is in the shed, and he goes in the shed and comes back empty-handed, because the shovel was leaning up on the outside of the shed. Imbecile",
